# Fischer-Discriminant
This project aims to do a Linear Discriminant Analysis using Fischer Discriminant. The dimensions of the dataset is reduced to 2 dimensions and then a fischer classifier is built to discriminate between positive and negative classes.


To analyze/experiment with the Fischer Discriminant:
1) Import the dataset on this colab notebook.
2) Add an appropriate path.
3) Run all the cells.
